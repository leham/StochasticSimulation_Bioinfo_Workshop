# Fundamentals of whole-cell modelling: stochastic simulation with Julia 
This repository contains all the materials, code, and resources for the workshop, which introduces participants to whole-cell modelling

## Key Learning Objectives
**Introduction to Whole-Cell Modelling**
   - Understand the fundamental principles of whole-cell modelling
   - Explore essential cellular processes such as:
     - Gene regulation
     - Protein synthesis and degradation
     - Metabolism
     - Cell-cycle dynamics

**Stochastic Modelling**
   - Learn about stochastic modelling and its application to biology
   - Use **Julia**, a powerful programming language for scientific computing, to simulate biochemical processes

## What You Will Learn
By the end of the workshop, participants will:
- Build and implement a minimal whole-cell model
- Develop a strong understanding of the theoretical and computational aspects of whole-cell modelling
- Acquire practical skills to analyse and simulate complex biological systems
