    "Julia is a relatively young programming language that has become very popular in numerical and scientific computing due to its simplicity and performance, and is increasingly more often used to analyse and model biological data and systems due to its active state-of-the-art package ecosystem (as shown in the figure above). It also boasts a rich infrastructure for scientific computing that approaches C/C++ speeds while being significantly more user-friendly. If you have used Python or Matlab before, you should find Julia's syntax very familiar. \n",
